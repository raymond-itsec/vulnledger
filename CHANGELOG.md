## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added a project changelog in Keep a Changelog format.
- Added a `.env.example` template for secure first-run configuration.

### Changed
- Updated the Caddy deployment to use a hostname-based site address so Automatic HTTPS can activate when `CADDY_HOST` is set to a public domain.
- Pinned the Caddy container image to `caddy:2.11.2-alpine` for reproducible deployments.
- Exposed `443/udp` on the Caddy service so HTTP/3 can work alongside HTTPS.
- Hardened the Docker Compose defaults by moving secrets and the initial admin bootstrap into environment variables and binding internal service ports to `127.0.0.1`.
- Changed OIDC login to bootstrap sessions from the refresh cookie instead of putting access tokens in the URL.
- Made ClamAV uploads fail closed when scanning is configured but unavailable.

### Fixed
- Escaped markdown-rendered finding, session, and template content to prevent stored XSS in the frontend preview and detail views.
- Enforced client-scope authorization checks on attachment listing and downloads.
